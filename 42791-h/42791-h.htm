<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>MARLOWE'S "LUST'S DOMINION."</h3>

  <p>The Rev. Mr. Dyce omits the play of <i>Lust's Dominion, or the
  Lascivious Queen</i>, from the excellent, and (in all other respects)
  complete edition of Marlowe's <i>Works</i> which he has lately published,
  considering it to have been "distinctly shown by Mr. Collier" that it
  could not have been the work of that poet. I must say, however, that the
  argument for its rejection does not appear to me by any means conclusive.
  It runs thus: in the first act is presented the death of a certain King
  Philip of Spain; and this King Philip must be Philip II., because in a
  tract printed in the <i>Somers' Collection</i>, giving an account of the
  "last words" of that monarch, are found passages which are plainly copied
  in the play. Now, Philip II. did not die till 1598, and the tract was not
  published till 1599, whereas Marlowe's death took place in 1593.
  <i>Ergo</i>, Marlowe could not have written <i>Lust's Dominion</i>. But
  we know that it was the constant custom of managers to cause acting plays
  to be altered and added to from time to time: the curious <i>Diary of
  Manager Henslowe</i> is full of entries of the payment of sums of twenty
  shillings or so, to the authors whom he kept, for "adycyons" to the works
  of others. And surely it is no forced hypothesis to suppose that some
  literary cobbler employed to touch up Marlowe's work, finding a King
  Philip in it, should have thought to improve and give it an air of
  historic truth, by introducing the circumstances furnished by the
  pamphlet into the death-scene. Apart from these particulars, the king is
  neither Philip I. nor Philip II., but a mere King Philip of Spain in
  general, quite superior to historical considerations. The positive
  evidence in support of Marlowe's authorship is tolerably strong, though
  not absolutely conclusive. The earliest extant edition of the play bears
  his name at full length on the title-page. It is true that the date of
  that edition is 1650, sixty-six years after his death: still the
  publisher must have had <i>some</i> reasonable ground for attributing the
  work to him; and in all cases comparatively little value ought to be
  attached to negative, when opposed by positive evidence. We <!-- Page 254
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254"></a>{254}</span>need look no
  farther than this very edition of Marlowe for an illustration of the
  possibility such a combination of circumstances as I have supposed. In
  the earliest known edition of the play of <i>Dr. Faustus</i> is found an
  allusion to a certain Dr. Lopez, who did not attain notoriety (by being
  hanged) till after Marlowe's death; but Mr. Dyce very justly only infers
  from this that the particular passage is an interpolation. According to
  the reasoning applied to <i>Lust's Dominion</i>, Faustus also should have
  been expelled summarily, upon this objection: and yet, in the case of
  that play, we know that such a conclusion from such premises would have
  been erroneous. I am unwilling to lay much stress on the internal
  evidence to be drawn from the language and conduct of the play itself,
  because I am aware how little reliance can be placed on reasoning drawn
  from such observations; but no one, I think, will deny that there are
  many passages which at least <i>might</i> have been written by Marlowe:
  and, on the whole, I submit that it would have been more satisfactory if
  Mr. Dyce had included it in this edition.</p>

  <p>He has changed his practice since he printed among Middleton's works
  (and rightly) the play of the <i>Honest Whore</i>, a play
  generally&mdash;I believe, universally&mdash;attributed to Dekker alone,
  on the authority of one single entry in Henslowe's <i>Diary</i>, where
  the names of the two poets are incidentally coupled together as joint
  authors of the piece!</p>

  <p>I should mention, that I take the dates and book-lore from Mr. Dyce
  himself.</p>

<h3>DOVER CASTLE: A NOTE TO HASTED.</h3>

  <p>Lambard, Camden, and Kilburne all speak of an accumulation of stores
  in Dover Castle, on the origin of which various traditions and opinions
  existed in their days.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Castell of Douer (sayth Lidgate and Rosse) was firste builded by
  Julius C√¶sar the Romane emperour, in memorie of whome, they of the
  castell kept, till this day, certeine vessels of olde wine and salte,
  whiche they affirme to be the remayne of suche prouision as he brought
  into it, as touching the whiche (if they be natural and not
  sophisticate), I suppose them more likely to have beene of that store
  whiche Hubert de Burghe layde in there."&mdash;<i>Lambard.</i></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In this castle likewise antiently was to be seen a tower (called
  C√¶sar's Tower), afterwards the king's lodgings (excellent for workmanship
  and very high),&mdash;a spacious hall (called King Arthur's Hall) with a
  faire gallery, or entry,&mdash;<i>great pipes and cashes (bound with iron
  hoopes), wherein was liquor (supposed to be wine) which by long lying
  became as thick as treackle</i>, and would <i>cleave like
  bird-lime</i>;&mdash;<i>salt congealed together as hard as stone</i>,
  cross bowes, long bowes, and arrowes to the same (<i>to which was
  fastened brass instead of feathers</i>); and the same were of such
  bigness as not fit to be used by any men of this or late
  ages."&mdash;<i>Kilburne.</i></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Camden relates that he was shown these arrows, which he thinks were
  such as the Romans used to shoot out of their engines, which were like to
  large crossbows. These last might, though not C√¶sar's, belong to the
  Romans of a later time; and the former might, perhaps, be part of the
  provisions and stores which King Henry VIII. laid in here, at a time when
  he passed from hence over sea to France; but for many years past it has
  not been known what is become of any of these
  things."&mdash;<i>Hasted.</i></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The following extract from an inventory furnished by William de
  Clynton, Earl of Huntyngdon, Lord Warden, on handing over the castle to
  Bartholomew de Burghersh, his successor, dated "die Sabati in vigilia
  sancti Thome Apostoli, anno regni regis Edwardi tercei a conquestu Anglie
  decimo septimo" (<i>i. e.</i> September 20, 1343), will supply a
  satisfactory elucidation of what these stores were:</p>

<h3>DEAN SWIFT: AUTOGRAPHS IN BOOKS.</h3>

  <p>The biographer and the critic, down to the pamphleteer and the
  lecturer, have united in painting St. Patrick's immortal Dean in the
  blackest colours. To their (for the most part) unmerited scandal and
  reproach thus heaped upon his memory (as little in accordance with truth
  as with Christian charity), let me, Mr. Editor, oppose the following
  brief but emphatic testimony on the bright (and I firmly believe the
  <i>right</i>) side of the question, of the virtuous, the accomplished
  Addison:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"To Dr. Jonathan Swift, The most Agreeable Companion, The Truest
  Friend, And the Greatest Genius of his Age, This Book is presented by his
  most Humble Servant the Authour."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The above inscription, in the autograph of Addison, is on the fly-leaf

<h3>SHAKSPEARE ELUCIDATIONS.</h3>

  <p>In <i>All's Well that Ends Well</i> (Act II. Sc. 1.) the king, when
  dismissing the young French noblemen who are going to the wars of Italy,
  says to them:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"Let higher Italy&mdash;</p>
      <p>Those 'bated that inherit but the fall</p>
      <p>Of the last monarchy&mdash;see, that you come</p>
      <p>Not to woo honour, but to wed it."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> calls this an "obscure passage,"
  and offers no explanation of it, merely giving a note of Coleridge's,
  who, after Hanmer, proposes to read <i>bastards</i> for <i>'bated</i>,
  saying of the passage itself: "As it stands, I can make little or nothing
  of it. Why should the king except the then most illustrious states,
  which, as being republics, were the more truly inheritors of the Roman
  grandeur?" Johnson, and the other preceding editors, seem to have taken a
  similar view of the passage.</p>

  <p>I trust it will not be regarded as presumption when I say, that to me
  the place offers no difficulty whatever. In the first place, <i>'bate</i>
  is not, as Coleridge takes it, to except, but to overcome, put an end to
  (from <i>abattre</i>); as when we say, "abate a nuisance." In the next,
  we are to recollect that the citizens of the Italian republics were
  divided into two parties,&mdash;the Guelf, or Papal, and the Ghibelline,
  or Imperial; and that the French always sided with the former. Florence,
  therefore, was Guelf at that time, and Siena of course was Ghibelline.
  The meaning of the king therefore is: By defeating the Ghibelline
  Sienese, let Italy see, &amp;c. As a Frenchman, he naturally affects a
  contempt for the German empire, and represents it as possessing (the
  meaning of <i>inherit</i> at the time) only the limited and tottering
  dominion which the empire of the west had at the time of its fall. By
  "higher Italy," by the way, I would understand not Upper Italy, but
  Tuscany, as more remote from France; for when the war is ended, the
  French envoy says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"What will Count Rousillon do then? Will he travel <i>higher</i>, or
  return again into France?"&mdash;Act IV. Sc. 3.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The meaning is plainly: Will he go farther on? to Naples, for
  example.</p>

  <p>I must take this opportunity of retracting what I have said
  about&mdash;</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span> (Vol. vi., p. 584.) by directing
  attention to the circumstance of <i>cub</i> being a young fox, has
  proved, at least to me, that <i>case</i> is the proper word,&mdash;a
  proof, among many, of the hazard of tampering with the text when not
  palpably wrong.</p>

  <p><i>Cub</i> is the young fox, and <i>fox</i>, <i>vixen</i>, <i>cub</i>
  are like <i>dog</i>, <i>bitch</i>, <i>whelp</i>,&mdash;<i>ram</i>,
  <i>ewe</i>, <i>lamb</i>, &amp;c. The word is peculiar to the English
  language, nothing at all resembling it being to be found in the
  Anglo-Saxon, or any of the kindred dialects. Holland, in his
  <i>Plutarch</i> (quoted by Richardson), when telling the story of the
  Spartan boy, says "a little <i>cub</i>, or young fox;" and then uses only
  <i>cub</i>. It was by analogy that the word was used of the young of
  bears, lions, and whales: and if Shakspeare in one place (<i>Merchant of
  Venice</i>, Act II. Sc. 1.) says "<i>cubs</i> of the she-bear," he
  elsewhere (<i>Titus Andronicus</i>, Act IV. Sc. 1.) has
  "bear-<i>whelps</i>." I further very much doubt if <i>cub</i> was used of
  boys in our poet's time. The earliest employment of it that I have seen
  is in Congreve, who uses "unlicked cubs," evidently alluding to young
  bears: and that is the sense in which <i>cub</i> is still used,&mdash;a
  sense that would not in any case apply to Viola.</p>

<h3>IMPRECATORY EPITAPHS.</h3>

  <p>There is a class of epitaphs, or, we should rather say, there are
  certain instances of monumental indecorum which have not as yet been
  noticed by the many contributors on these subjects to your pages. I refer
  to those inscriptions embodying threats, or expressing resentful feelings
  against the murderers, or supposed murderers, of the deceased individual.
  Of such epitaphs we have fortunately but few examples in Great Britain;
  but in Norway, among the Runic monuments of an early and rude age, they
  are by no means uncommon.</p>

  <p>Near the door of the church of Knaresdale, in Northumberland, is the
  following on a tombstone:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"In Memory of <span class="sc">Robert Baxter</span>, of Farhouse,</p>
      <p class="i3">who died Oct. 4, 1796, aged 56.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"All you that please these lines to read,</p>
      <p>It will cause a tender heart to bleed.</p>
      <p>I murdered was upon the fell,</p>
      <p>And by the man I knew full well;</p>
      <p>By bread and butter, which he'd laid,</p>
      <p>I, being harmless, was betray'd.</p>
      <p><i>I hope he will rewarded be</i></p>
      <p>That laid the poison there for me."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Robert Baxter is still remembered by persons yet living, and the
  general belief in the country is, that he was poisoned by a neighbour
  with whom he had had a violent quarrel. Baxter was well known to be a man
  of voracious appetite; and it seems that, one morning on going out to the
  fell (or hill), he found a piece of bread and butter wrapped in white
  paper. This he incautiously devoured, and died a few hours after in great
  agony. The suspected individual was, it is said, alive in 1813.</p>

  <p>We know not how much of the old Norse blood ran in the veins of Robert
  Baxter's friend, who composed this epitaph; but this summer, among a
  people of avowedly Scandinavian descent, I copied the following from a
  large and handsome tomb in the burying-ground of the famous Cross Kirk,
  in Northmavine parish, in Shetland:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="ac">
"M.S.<br />
<span class="sc">Donald Robertson</span>,<br />
Born 1st of January, 1785; died 4th of June, 1848,<br />
aged 63 years.
</p>

  <p>He was a peaceable quiet man, and to all appearance a sincere
  Christian. His death was very much regretted, which was caused by the
  stupidity of Laurence Tulloch, of Clotherten, who sold him nitre instead
  of Epsom salts, by which he was killed in the space of three hours after
  taking a dose of it."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Among the Norwegian and Swedish Runic inscriptions figured by
  G√∂sannson and Sj√∂borg, we meet with two or three breathing a still more
  revengeful spirit, but one eminently in accordance with the rude
  character of the age to which they belong (<span class="sm">A.D.</span>
  900 ad 1300).</p>

  <p>An epitaph on a stone figured by Sj√∂borg runs as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Rodvisl and Rodalf they caused this stone to be raised after their
  three sons, and after [to] Rodfos. Him the Blackmen slew in foreign
  lands. God help the soul of Rodfos: <i>God destroy them that killed
  him.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Another stone figured by G√∂sannson has engraved on it the same
  revengeful aspiration.</p>

  <p>We all remember the Shakspearian inscription, "Cursed be he that moves
  my bones;" but if Finn Magnussen's interpretation be correct, there is an
  epitaph in Runic characters at Greniadarstad church, in Iceland, which
  concludes thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If you willingly remove this monument, may you sink into the
  ground."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It would be curious to collect examples of these menaces on
  tombstones, and I hope that other contributors will help to rescue any
  that exist in this or in other countries from oblivion.</p>

<h3>DERIVATION OF "LAD" AND "LASS."</h3>

  <p>The derivation of the word <i>lad</i> has not yet been given, so far
  as I am aware; and the word <i>lass</i> is in the same predicament.
  <i>Lad</i> is undoubtedly of old usage in England, and in its archaic
  sense it has reference, not to age, as now, but to service or dependence;
  being applied, not to signify a youth or a boy, but a servant or
  inferior. <!-- Page 257 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page257"></a>{257}</span></p>

  <p>In Pinkerton's <i>Poems from the Maitland MSS.</i> is one, purporting
  to be the composition of Thomas of Ercildoune, which begins thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"When a man is made a kyng of a capped man."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>After this line follow others of the same bearing, until we come to
  these:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"When rycht aut wronge astente togedere,</p>
      <p>When laddes weddeth lovedies," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The prophet is not, in these words, inveighing against ill-assorted
  alliances between young men and old women; but is alluding to a general
  <i>bouleversement</i> of society, when <i>m√©salliances</i> of noble women
  to ignoble men will take place.</p>

  <p>This sense of the word gives us, I think, some help towards tracing
  its derivation, and I have no doubt that its real parent is the
  Anglo-Saxon <i>hlaf√¶ta</i>,&mdash;a word to be found in one instance
  only, in a corner of √Üthelbyrt's <i>Domas</i>: "Gif man ceorles
  <i>hlaf√¶tan</i> of-sl√¶th vi scyllingum gebete."</p>

  <p>By the same softening of sound which made <i>lord</i> and <i>lady</i>
  out of <i>hlaford</i> and <i>hl√¶fdige</i>, <i>hlaf√¶ta</i> became
  <i>lad</i>, and <i>hlaf√¶tstre</i> became <i>lass</i>. As the lord
  supplied to his dependents the bread which they ate, so each thus derived
  from the loaf the appellation of their mutual relation, in the plain
  phraseology of our ancestors.</p>

  <p>Dr. Leo, in his interesting commentary on the <i>Rectitudines
  singularum personarum</i> (edit. Halle, 1842, p. 144.), says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ganz analog dem Verh√§ltnisse von <i>ealdore</i> und <i>gingra</i> ist
  das Verh√§ltniss von <i>hlaford</i> (brodherrn), <i>hl√¶fdige</i>
  (brodherrin), und <i>hlaf√¶ta</i> (brodeszer). <i>Hlaford</i> ist am Ende
  zum Standestitel (lord) geworden; urspr√ºnglich bezeichnet es jeden
  Gebieter; die Kinder, die Leibeignen, die abh√§ngigen freien Leute, alles
  was zum Hausstande und zum Gefolge eines Mannes geh√∂rt, werden als dessen
  <i>hlaf√¶tan</i> bezeichnet."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Perhaps some of your readers may favour myself and others by giving
  the derivation of <i>boy</i> and <i>girl</i>.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Iona.</i>&mdash;The ancient name of this celebrated island was
  <i>I</i> (an island), or <i>I-Columbkille</i> (the island of Columba of
  the Churches). In all the ancient tombstones still existing in the
  island, it is called nothing but <i>Hy</i>; and I have no doubt that its
  modern name of <i>Iona</i> is a corruption, arising from mistaking
  <i>u</i> for <i>n</i>. In the very ancient copy of Adamnan's <i>Life of
  St. Columbkille</i>, formerly belonging to the monastery of Reichenau
  (<i>Augia Dives</i>), and now preserved in the town library of
  Schaffhausen, which I had an opportunity of examining very carefully last
  summer, the name is written everywhere, beyond the possibility of doubt,
  <i>Ioua</i>, which was evidently an attempt to give a power of Latinised
  declension to the ancient Celtic <i>I</i>. It was pronounced <i>I-wa</i>
  (<i>i.e.</i> <i>Ee-wa</i>). Who first made the blunder of changing the
  <i>u</i> into <i>n</i>?</p>

  <p><i>"Prigging Tooth" or "Pugging Tooth."</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr.
  Collier</span>, in his new book on Shakspeare, containing early
  manuscript corrections of the folio of 1632, says at page 191., in
  enumerating those of the <i>Winter's Tale</i>, that the emendator
  substitutes (Act IV. Sc. 2.) "prigging tooth" for the "pugging tooth" of
  the old copies. Now this, I believe, has been the generally received
  interpretation, but it is quite wrong. <i>Prigging</i>, that is stealing,
  tooth, would be nonsense; <i>pugging</i> is the correct word, and is most
  expressive. Antolycus means his molar&mdash;his grinding tooth is set on
  edge.</p>

  <p>A pugging-mill (sometimes abbreviated and called pug-mill) is a
  machine for crushing and tempering lime, consisting of two heavy rollers
  or wheels in a circular trough; the wheels are hung loose upon the ends
  of a bar of iron or axle-tree, which is fastened by the centre either to
  the top or bottom of an upright spindle, moved by a horse or other power,
  as the case may be, thus causing the wheels in their circuit to revolve
  from their friction upon the trough, and so to bruise the nuts of lime,
  which together with the sand and water are fed by a labourer, who removes
  the mortar when made. The machine is of course variously constructed for
  the kind of work it has to do: there is a pugging-mill used in the making
  of bricks that is fitted with projecting knives to cut and knead the
  clay. <!-- Page 258 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page258"></a>{258}</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Emendator</span> has doubtless restored the sense to

  in reading <i>prigging</i> for <i>pugging</i>.</p>

<h3>NATIONAL PORTRAITS.&mdash;PORTRAIT OF THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, SON OF CHARLES I.</h3>

  <p>A cotemporary portrait of this prince, fourth son of Charles I., was
  in existence. He was represented with a fountain by him, probably in
  early age. He died, at the age of twenty, in 1660. Where is this painting
  now to be found, or is any engraving from it known? Granger describes an
  engraved portrait by Vaughan, representing the infant prince seated on a
  cushion; and a rare portrait of him by Lovell.</p>

  <p>It would be very desirable to compile a descriptive catalogue of
  painted portraits, those especially preserved in the less accessible
  private collections in England. Such a manual, especially if illustrated
  with outline sketches or photographs, in order to render it available at
  a moderate cost, would be most useful, and supply, in some degree, the
  deficiency of any extensive public collection of national portraits, such
  as has been commenced in France, at the palace of Versailles.</p>

<h3>WELBORNE FAMILY.</h3>

  <p>In Burke's <i>Extinct Peerage</i> it is stated that John de Lacy,
  first Earl of Lincoln, died <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1240, leaving
  one son and two daughters. The latter were removed, in the twenty-seventh
  year of Hen. III., to Windsor, there to be educated with the daughters of
  the king. One of these sisters, Lady Maud de Lacy, married Richard de
  Clare, Earl of Gloucester; but I can find no mention of either the name
  or marriage of the other. Am I correct in identifying her with "Dorothy,
  daughter of the Earl of Lincoln," who married Sir John Welborne (see
  <i>Harl. MSS.</i> 888. 1092-1153.)? The dates in the Welborne pedigree
  perfectly correspond with this assumption.</p>

  <p>Another question relative to this family is of greater interest, and I
  should feel sincerely obliged by any answer to it. Simon de Montfort,
  earl of Leicester, married Eleanora, daughter of King John, and had by
  her five children. The fourth son is called Richard in Burke's <i>Royal
  Families</i>, vol. i. p. xxiii.; and the report is added, that "he
  remained in England in privacy under the name of Wellsburn." In the
  <i>Extinct Peerage</i>, the name of the same son is Almaric, of whom it
  says: "When conveying his sister from France, to be married to Leoline,
  Prince of Wales, he was taken prisoner with her at sea, and suffered a
  long imprisonment. He was at last, however, restored to liberty, and his
  posterity are said to have flourished in England under the name of
  Wellsburne." Is it not to be presumed that the above Sir John Welborne
  (living, as he must have done, in the latter half of the thirteenth
  century, and allying himself with the great family especially protected
  by Henry III., uncle of the De Montforts) was himself the son of Richard
  or Almaric de Montfort, and founder of that family of Wellesburne, said
  to have "flourished in England"? The De Montforts no doubt abandoned
  their patronymic in consequence of the attainder of Simon, earl of
  Leicester, and adopted that of Wellesburne from the manor of that name,
  co. Warwick, in the possession of Henry de Montfort temp. Ric. I.</p>

  <p>The only known branch of the Welborns terminated (after ten descents
  from Sir John) in coheiresses, one of whom married in 1574, and brought
  the representation into a family which counts among its members your
  correspondent</p>

<h3>DESCENDANTS OF SIR HUMPHREY GILBERT.</h3>

  <p>In a work published not many years ago, entitled <i>Antigua and the
  Antiguans</i>, by Mrs. Flannigan, there is the following passage:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Hon. Nathaniel Gilbert, Speaker of the House of Assembly in the
  island of Antigua, and one of the chief proprietors in that island,
  derived his descent from a family of considerable distinction in the west
  of England, where one of its members, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, associating
  himself with his kinsman, Sir Walter Raleigh, became one of the most
  eminent circumnavigators of the reign of Queen Elizabeth."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Dying, he left a son, Raleigh Gilbert, who along with others obtained
  from King James I. a large grant of land, in what was then called
  Plymouth, but which now forms part of the colony of Virginia. To this
  place he emigrated with Lord Chief Justice Popham in 1606. Afterwards he
  succeeded to an estate in Devonshire on the death of his elder brother,
  Sir John Gilbert, President of the Virginian Company.</p>

  <p>Can any of your correspondents kindly inform me from what source I can
  complete the line of <!-- Page 260 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page260"></a>{260}</span>descent, by filling up the interval of
  three or four generations between the above Raleigh Gilbert and the Hon.
  Nathaniel Gilbert mentioned by Mrs. Flannigan?</p>

  <p>The present Sir George Colebrook and Sir William Abdy are connected,
  more or less remotely, with the last-mentioned Mr. Gilbert.</p>

  <p>The English branch of the family is now established at Tredrea in
  Cornwall. (See <i>Burke</i>.)</p>

  <p>Any information whatever upon this subject would be exceedingly
  valuable to the inquirer.</p>

  class="sc">Mr. Dredge's</span> list (Vol. vi., p. 203.) was very
  acceptable and interesting; but he has left unanswered several points
  regarding these bishops. 1. <i>Bishop Scot's</i> death is given as at
  Louvain, but not the period when it occurred. 2. <i>Bishop Bayne</i> is
  merely said to have "died at Islington in 1560," month unnoticed. 3.
  <i>Bishop Goldwell</i> is "said to have died shortly afterwards (1580) at
  Rome," while I gave my authority as to his being still alive in the year
  1584 (Vol. vi., p. 100.). 4. <i>Bishop Pate</i> is said to have also
  "died at Louvain," but no date is mentioned. 5. <i>Bishop Pole</i> "died
  in 1568." Is neither the place nor month known? In conclusion, with
  regard to the "English bishops deprived, 1691," only the years of the
  deaths of <i>Bishops Frampton</i> and <i>White</i> are stated. I trust
  <span class="sc">Mr. Dredge</span>, if he sees this, will forgive my

  mentioned by Brand was at Kingston-upon-Thames, in 1745. In Leicester,

  <p>I have been informed by an octogenarian inhabitant of this town, that

  disgrace, against the residence of a notorious scold; and the fact of
  this use of it here at so comparatively recent a period has been
  confirmed by another aged person, so that this practice probably obtained
  for some years after the punishment by immersion, or exposure upon the
  cucking-stool, had fallen into desuetude.</p>

  Begeham (the modern Bayham), on the borders of Sussex, in the reign of
  Henry II., whose nephew, Sir Robert de Turneham, appears to have been

  <p><i>Open Seats or Pews in Churches.</i>&mdash;Mr. Barr (<i>Anglican

  experience, found most convenient for many parts of this description of
  church fitting; but he gives not the length of each sitting, or, in other
  words, the space, measured along the length of the bench, that should be
  allowed for each person. Neither does he give the height nor the breadth
  of the flat board to rest the elbows on when kneeling, or to place the
  books upon, which he proposes to substitute for the common sloping
  bookboard. Neither does he appear to have paid any attention to the
  disposal of the hats with which every male worshipper must, I fear,
  continue to be encumbered, and which I like not to see impaled on the
  poppy-heads, nor plied on the font, nor to feel against my knees when I
  sit down, nor against my feet when I kneel. If any of your correspondents
  could name a church in the open seats of which these things have been
  attended to, and well done, I should be much disposed to go and study it
  as a model for imitation; and if satisfied with it, I should want little
  persuasion for commencing the destruction of my old manor pew, and the
  fixing of open seats on its site.</p>

  Markshall had inhumanly refused to defray. I think I have somewhere read

  Leicester and his family, and which he that compares with these memoirs,
  will not take to be an idle conjecture, there are so many passages so
  easily illustrable, by comparing it with these memoirs. The book I mean
  is the <i>History of Reynard the Fox</i>, in which the author, not daring
  to write his history plainly, probably for fear of his power, has

  Curle to the memory of their beloved mistress the Queen of Scots; but it
  will be found to have been rather erected to the memory of those two
  ladies by Hippolytus Curle, the son of the former, and nephew of the
  latter, in or subsequent to the year 1620. The notice of it in my
  Murray's <i>Handbook</i> of 1850 is brief but accurate:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Against a pillar, facing the right transept, is a portrait of Mary
  Queen of Scots, attached to a monument erected to the memory of two
  English ladies named Curle, who served her as ladies in waiting. One of
  them received her last embrace previous to her execution."</p>

  <p>I beg to refer your correspondents to a Memoir by Mons. C. P. Serrure,
  which appeared in tom. iii. of the <i>Messager des Sciences et des Arts
  de la Belgique</i>, 1835, pp. 89-96., and was afterwards published at
  Ghent in a separate form, under the title of <i>Notice sur le Mausol√©e de
  Barbe Moubray et Elizabeth Curle, dames d'honneur de la reine Marie
  Stuart, qui se voit dans l'Eglise paroissiale de Saint Andr√©, √†
  Anvers</i>, with an engraving of the monument. As the inscription conveys
  some biographical particulars of the ladies whose virtues it
  commemorates, and as this information is asked for by <span

<h3>RIGBY CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 203.)</p>

  <p>I am a little surprised at the slight knowledge K. K. seems to have of
  Mr. Rigby&mdash;nor do I quite understand his statement: he says he
  possesses sixty-seven letters of Mr. Rigby to his <i>own grandfather</i>,
  and that his object is to discover, what he calls, the <i>counterpart of
  the correspondence</i>: and then he talks of this
  <i>counter-correspondent</i>, as if he knew no more of him than that he
  was an M. P., and "seems" to have done so and so. Now this
  counter-correspondent must have been his grandfather: and it would surely
  have simplified the inquiry if he had stated at once the name of his
  grandfather, whose letters he is anxious to recover. Mr. Rigby was one of
  the busiest politicians of the busy times in which he lived. He did not,
  as K. K. supposes, reside <i>altogether</i> in England. He was chief
  secretary to the Duke of Bedford when Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, from
  1757 to 1761; in which period he obtained the lucrative sinecure of
  Master of the Rolls in Ireland, which he enjoyed for upwards of twenty
  years; during which he was a prominent figure in English and Irish
  politics, and was long the leader of the Bedford party in the English
  House of Commons. His correspondence would be likely to be, with any one
  he confided in, important; and with any body, very amusing: for, though a
  deep politician, he was of a gay, frank, jovial, and gossiping
  disposition. It was he who, when some questions were carried against him
  in the Irish parliament, and that some of his English friends wrote to
  ask him whether he would not resign on such an affront, concealed his
  political feelings under the jolly <i>bon-vivant</i> style of answering:
  "What care I about their affronts! there is nothing in the world I like
  half so well as woodcock-shooting and claret-drinking, and <i>here</i> I
  have both in perfection: why should I resign?" He died in 1788; and was
  succeeded in his estate at Mirtley, in Essex, by <i>Lieut.-Col. Hale
  Rigby</i> (who, I think, but am not sure, assumed the name of Rigby for
  the estate), and who had an only daughter who married the late Lord
  Rivers; and whose son is now, I presume, the representative of Mr.
  Rigby&mdash;the owner of Mirtley&mdash;and probably, if they be in
  existence, the possessor of the "counter-correspondence" that K. K.
  inquires after. I have been thus particular in answering, as far as I
  can, K. K.'s <i>Query</i>, because I believe that any confidential
  correspondence of Mr. Rigby must be very interesting, and I am glad to
  suggest where K. K. may look for the "counterpart;" but, whether they be
  obtained or not, I am inclined to believe that Mr. Rigby's own letters
  would be worth publication, if, as I have already hinted, his
  correspondent was really in either his private or political
  confidence.</p>

  <p>A considerable number of this gentleman's letters were addressed to

<h3>MARIGMERII&mdash;MELINGLERII&mdash;BEREFELLARII.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 207.)</p>

  <p>P. C. S. S. has ascertained that all the barbarous terms medi√¶vally
  applied to certain classes of the inferior clergy, and referred to by
  <span class="sc">Mr. Jebb</span> (<i>ant√®</i>, p. 207.), are explained in
  the <i>Glossarium</i> of Ducange. They are identical in meaning and
  derivation, though slightly differing in point of spelling, with
  "Marigmerii" and "Melinglerii" (cited by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Jebb</span>), "Marellarii," "Meragalarii," and "Malingrerii," and are all
  to be found in the learned work to which reference is now made. Of the
  last of these words, Pirri himself (who is quoted by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Jebb</span>) gives the explanation, which is equally applicable to them
  all. He says (in <i>Archiepisc. Messan.</i>, sub an. 1347):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Malingrerium</i>, olim dictum qui hodie <i>Sacrista</i> est."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Ducange also thus explains the cognate word <i>Marrellarius</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"√Üdituus, custos √¶dis sacr√¶, vulgo <i>Marguillier</i>," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Jebb</span> is therefore undoubtedly right in
  identifying the signification of these terms with that of the French
  "Marguillier," the Latin phrase for which is <i>Matricularius</i>, so
  called because those officers were selected from the paupers who were
  admitted into the <i>Matricula</i>, or <i>hospice</i> adjoining the
  church or convent:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ex Matriculariis pauperibus quidam seligebantur ad viliora
  Ecclesiarum adjacentium munia, <i>v.g.</i> qui <!-- Page 265 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page265"></a>{265}</span>campanas pulsarent,
  ecclesiarum custodi√¶ invigilarent [<i>church-wardens</i> in the true
  sense of the word], eas scoparent ac mundarent. Atque inde
  Matriculariorum (nostris <i>Marguillier</i>) in ecclesiis parochialibus
  origo."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Of another singular word, <i>Berefellarii</i>, and of the adoption of
  <i>Person√¶</i> instead of it, the history is very amusing, though,
  perhaps, scarcely fit for the pages of "N. &amp; Q." It would seem that
  these inferior servitors of the church were not very cleanly in their
  person or habits. The English populace, by a not very delicate pun on
  their name, were wont to call them <i>bewrayed fellows</i>, the meaning
  of which it is not necessary farther to explain. In a letter of Thomas,
  Archbishop of York (preserved in Dugdale's <i>Monasticon</i>, tom. <span
  class="sm">III.</span> p. ii. p. 5.), the good prelate says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Scilicet Pr√¶centoris, Cancellarii, et Sacrist√¶, ac Septem Personarum
  qui olim <i>Berefellarii</i> fuerunt nuncupati.... Sed quia eorum turpe
  nomen <i>Berefellariorum</i>, patens risui remanebat, dictos Septem de
  c√¶tero non <i>Berefellarios</i> sed <i>Personas</i> volumus
  nuncupari."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The glossarist adds, with some <i>na√Øvet√©</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Cur autem ita obsc√¶na hujusmodi iis indita appellatio, dicant Angli
  ipsi!"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author">P. C. S. S.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Jebb</span>, in his Query respecting the
  <i>exotic√¶ voces</i> "Marigmerii" and "Melinglerii," seems to be right in
  his conjecture that they are both of them corruptions of some word
  answering to the French <i>Marguillier</i>, a churchwarden. The word in
  question is probably <i>Meragularius</i>. It appears to be a term but
  rarely used, and to occur but once in Martene, <i>De Antiq. Eccl.
  Ritibus</i>, tom. i. p. 233., Venice, 1783, in the conclusion of his
  extract "de ordinario MS. ecclesi√¶ Cabilonensis;" where the officer in
  question performs the duty of the Vestararius:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Diaconus et Subdiaconus inter se plicant vestimenta sua, Meragularius
  pr√¶stat auxilium sacerdoti."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Though elsewhere Martene explains the term by "√Üdituus, custos
  √¶dis."</p>

  <p>With regard to the latter word, the meaning of which <span
  class="sc">Mr. Jebb</span> inquires, <i>Berefellarii</i>, I may suggest
  that he will find, on reading somewhat further in the archbishop's
  <i>Statuta</i> for Beverley, a further account of these same
  <i>Berefellarii</i>; which almost precludes the likelihood of a blunder
  in the original document, or at least of <i>Beneficiarii</i> being the
  correct word. For the archbishop, having occasion to mention them again,
  gives the origin of their institution:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Quos quidem Berefellarios recolend√¶ memori√¶ Dom. Johannes de Thoresby
  dudum Eborum Archiepiscopus ad honorem dict√¶ Ecclesi√¶ Beverlaci, et
  majorem decentiam ministrantium in eadem provincia ordinabat."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He then proceeds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sed quia eorum turpe nomen Berefellariorum, patens risui remanebat,
  dictos Septem de c√¶tero non Berefellarios sed Personas volumus
  nuncupari."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And accordingly we find them called hereafter in this document by the
  very indefinite appellation, <i>Septem Person√¶</i>.</p>

  <p>The word <i>Berefellarii</i> seems obviously to be of Anglo-Saxon
  origin; as well from the extract I have given above, as from the absence
  of the term in works on the continental rituals, as Martene for instance.
  And I would suggest, in default of a better derivation, that the word may
  have been Latinised from the Anglo-Saxon <i>bere fellan</i> or
  <i>sellan</i>. The office would then be that of almoner, and the
  <i>Berefellarii</i> would be the "persons" who doled out victuals to the
  poor; literally, <i>barley-givers</i>. Such an original would make the
  term liable to the objection to which the archbishop alluded; and the
  office does not altogether disagree with what was stated as the object of
  its institution, viz.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ad honorem ecclesi√¶ Beverlaci, et majorem decentiam ministrantium in
  eadem."</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC NOTES AND QUERIES.</h3>

  <p><i>Replies to Photographic Questions.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Sir
  William Newton</span> is right respecting the active properties of
  sulphuric acid; it should therefore not be stronger than merely tasting
  of the acid; but it has appeared to me to possess a superior effect in
  setting the alkalies free. I believe muriatic acid would have precisely
  the same effect, or Beaufoy's acetic acid, though it would be rather
  expensive. Starch would be invaluable both for positives or negatives, if
  it could be laid on perfectly even; but if pinned up to dry it all runs
  to one corner, and if laid flat it runs into ridges. Perhaps some artist
  may be able to favour us with the best mode of treating starch; its
  non-solubility in cold water makes it an invaluable agent in
  photography.</p>

  <p>The above includes a reply to <span class="sc">Mr. J. James'</span>
  first Query: to his second, the solution may be either brushed or
  floated, but all solutions require even greater care than doing a
  water-colour drawing, to lay them perfectly flat. The remaining questions
  depend for answer simply on the experience of the operator: the formula
  given was simply for iodizing paper; the bringing out, exposure in the
  camera, &amp;c., have been so clearly described lately by <span
  class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span>, it would be useless to give further
  directions at present.</p>

  <p>G. H. should dispense with the aceto-nitrate and gallic acid, and
  bring up with gallic acid and glacial acetic acid only. This makes no
  dirt whatever, and is quite as effective. The marbling <!-- Page 266
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page266"></a>{266}</span>he alludes to
  proceeds from the sensitive solution not being sufficiently dry when put
  into the camera. Even if prepared paper is blotted off, which I think a
  very bad plan, it should have some time allowed it to dry; also the
  faintness of the image depends either upon not giving time enough, or the
  aperture he uses for his lens is much too large; or again, he has not
  found the true chemical focus,&mdash;it varies in single meniscus lenses
  sometimes as much as three-eighths of an inch nearer the eye than the
  visual:&mdash;all these are causes of indistinct images, and require
  patience to rectify them.</p>

  <p>I beg leave to subscribe entirely to <span class="sc">Mr. W.
  Brown's</span> remarks on the subject of Mr. Archer and collodion. I have
  one of Mr. Horne's handbills, circulated with the first samples of
  collodion, headed "Archer's prepared collodion" in 1851, and had some of
  the earliest in the market. That Mr. Archer should fail in trying his own
  preparation goes for nothing at all, because, at the best of times, and
  with the most skilful, failures are often numerous and mortifying, in
  photography above all other arts; therefore, unless some more correct
  data are given, the merit rests entirely on Mr. Archer.</p>

  <p><i>Developing Paper Pictures with Pyrogallic Acid</i> (Vol. vii., p.

  I have long been in the habit of doing so by the following process. Of
  Mr. Archer's developing solution, viz.,</p>

<table class="mc">

<td> 3 grs.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Acetic acid</td>
<td> 1 drachm.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Distilled water</td>
<td> 1 oz.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>take twenty grs. (minims): add an equal quantity of distilled water,
  and five drops (minims) of acetic acid. I pour the mixture upon a glass
  plate, and put the sensitive surface of any picture upon it; moving, it
  up and down by one corner, to prevent the paper being stained, and to
  observe the development of the picture; which, when sufficiently come
  out, I blot and wash immediately, and fix with hyposulphite of soda or
  bromide of potassium.</p>

  <p><i>Photography in the Open Air; Improved Camera.</i>&mdash;In your
  Number 172, p. 163., there is a Note of mine in reference to the use to
  which thin sheet India rubber might be applied. I there alluded to the
  difficulties attending a single "portable camera," in which all the
  coating, developing, &amp;c. of your plates is to be done; and for those
  gentlemen who have the means of carrying about with them a second box, I
  have devised a modification of Archer's camera, which I think, will prove
  very useful. It is one which I am about to make for myself. This second
  box is one in which, when travelling, I can pack my camera, frames,
  glasses, and chemicals. Having arranged your camera, you proceed to
  arrange the second box, or "laboratory." This laboratory has three short
  legs, which screw, or fasten by any simple contrivance, to it, so that it
  may stand a sufficient height from the ground to allow the bath, which
  fits in like the one in Archer's camera, to hang beneath it, and also
  that when working you may do so with ease. It is lighted by either yellow
  glass or India rubber. There are sleeves of India rubber for your arms,
  and the holes in the sides of the box traverse nearly the whole of the
  sides, for the purpose of moving your hands freely from one end of the
  box to the other; there is also an opening for the head. The bottom of
  the box is divided: about two-thirds of it, and the nearest to you, has a
  gutta percha tray, with the four sides, three inches high, fitting it
  quite tight; and in one corner a tube a few inches long, also of gutta
  percha, fixed to it, and passing through the bottom of the box, to allow
  the refuse washings to run off. In the middle of this tray a developing
  stand of gutta percha is fixed to the bottom, on which to lay the glass
  plates. The other one-third of the bottom of the laboratory is fitted
  thus:&mdash;There is a slit across the box, immediately before the wall
  of the tray, for the nitrate of silver bath to slip in. Immediately
  beyond the edge of the bath is a small fillet of wood running across the
  box parallel with the bath, and so placed that if the bottom of the dark
  frame to contain the glass plate is rested against it, and the top of the
  frame rested against the end of the laboratory, the frame will slope at
  about an angle of forty-five degrees. Let there be a button, or similar
  contrivance, on the underside of the lid of the box, that the lid of the
  dark frame may be fastened to it when open. Bottles of collodion,
  developing fluid, hypo-soda, or solution of salt, &amp;c., may be
  arranged in various convenient ways within reach. The proceeding then is
  very easy. Place the bath-frame and bottles in their places; rear the
  glass plate in the frame; shut the laboratory lid; place your hands in
  the sleeves and your head in the hood; fix the door of dark frame to the
  top; coat the plate; place it in the bath with collodion side from you
  (it will then be in convenient position when you draw it out of bath to
  place at once in the frame); fasten the frame door; open the box lid;
  remove to camera; after taking picture, return frame to its place in
  camera; bring the plate to developing stand; develop; pour solution of
  salt over; remove from box; finish outside with hyposulphite of soda.</p>

  <p>I have been thus explicit to render the matter as plain and
  intelligible as possible without aid of diagrams. But I shall be happy to
  give any <!-- Page 267 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page267"></a>{267}</span>one any further information, either
  privately, or through "N. &amp; Q." It seems to me that by this
  contrivance you simplify the process as much as is almost possible; you
  keep separate the different processes, and run little or no risk of
  mixing your chemicals, a misfortune which would spoil several hours'
  work, as well as entail a considerable loss of materials. The box would
  be no expensive article; any one possessing a little mechanical skill
  could construct it for himself, and its use as a packing-case for your
  apparatus would repay the cost.</p>

  <p>I have for some time been using a developing fluid, which appears to
  have some desirable qualifications for it is simple, inexpensive, and
  keeps good, as far as I have tried it, for a very long period. I have
  worked with it when it has been made ten weeks; it slightly changes
  colour, but it throws down no deposit, and does not ever stain the film;
  when first made, it is colourless as water. <span class="sc">Dr.
  Diamond</span> has kindly undertaken to test its value, and if he
  pronounces it worthy of being made known, the readers of "N. &amp; Q."
  shall shortly have the benefit of it.</p>

  <p><i>New Effect in Collodion Pictures.</i>&mdash;In the course of some
  experiments I have been following in reference to a photographic subject,
  a method by which a new effect in pictures on glass may be obtained has
  occurred to me. Such productions, when treated as positives, are of
  course white pictures upon a black ground; and although for beauty of
  detail they are superior to those belonging to any other process, there
  is a certain harshness and want of artistic effect: to remedy this, I
  turned my attention towards obtaining a dark picture upon a light ground,
  as is the case when glass photographs are printed from; in this I have
  succeeded, and as the modification affords a pleasing variation, it may
  be acceptable to the tastes of some of your readers. The principle I
  proceed upon is to copy, by means of the camera, from a previously-taken
  picture in a negative state. Suppose, for instance, our subject is an
  out-door view: I take a collodion picture&mdash;which would answer for a
  positive if backed with black: this, viewed by transmitted light, is of
  course negative,&mdash;an effect which may be produced by placing a piece
  of white paper behind it from this <i>white</i><span
  class="nw">-backed</span> plate: I take another collodion picture, which,
  being reversed in light and shade, is negative by reflected light; but
  viewed as a transparency is <i>positive</i>, and of course retains that
  character when backed with white paint, paper, or other substance lighter
  in colour than the parts formed by the reduced silver. Instead of the
  first picture being formed by the glass, any of the paper processes may
  be adopted which will afford negative pictures. Copies of prints may be
  beautifully produced on this principle by obtaining the first or negative
  by the ordinary process of printing. As these pictures are to form a
  contrast with a white ground, they should be as brown in tint as
  possible; nitric acid, or other whitening agents, being avoided in the
  developing solutions for both negative and positive. By this process the
  detail and contrasts can be kept far better than by the operation of
  printing: for it is exceedingly difficult to obtain a picture which will
  convey to the prepared surface an amount of light corresponding to the
  natural lights and shades, and the trouble of making collodion copies is
  far less than printing. There is certainly the drawback of having the
  copies upon glass: I think, however, that some white flexible substance
  may be found, upon which the collodion, albumen, &amp;c., may be spread;
  but if they be intended for framing, of course they are better on glass.
  The general effect is that of a sepia drawing. The picture first taken
  and used as a negative, may be preserved as a positive by removing the
  white back, and treating it in the usual manner.</p>

  <p>Permit me to observe, that much confusion arises from the
  <i>manner</i> in which the terms positive and negative are often used; a
  negative glass picture is frequently spoken of as a definite, distinct
  thing; this is not the case, for all photographic pictures upon glass are
  both negative and positive, accordingly as they are seen upon a back of
  lighter or darker shade than the reduced silver&mdash;by transmitted or
  reflected light. A picture intended to be printed from is no more a
  negative than another, its positive character being merely obscured by
  longer exposure in the camera. When first removed from the developing
  solution, glass pictures are negative, because they are seen upon the
  iodide of silver, which is a light ground. This is a thing of course well
  known to many of your readers, but beginners are, I know, often puzzled
  by it.</p>

  <p><i>Chatterton</i> (Vol. vii., p. 189.).&mdash;J. M. G. informs N. B.
  that he is possessed of the whole of the late Mr. Hazlewood's collection
  of volumes, tracts, and cuttings from periodicals, published during the
  period when the Rowleian and Chattertonian <!-- Page 268 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page268"></a>{268}</span>controversy engrossed
  so much of public criticism and dispute.</p>

  <p>He has likewise various other articles relating to Chatterton, both in
  print and manuscript, collected during many years that he was resident at
  and connected with Bristol, which then naturally interested him in the
  subject. But what would be of far greater use to N. B. in ascertaining
  who was the author of the Rowleian poems, is an essay in manuscript,
  recently furnished to J. M. G. by a gentleman now resident in Bristol,
  whose ancestors were acquainted with Chatterton's family, and who has in
  this document shown, not only great arch√¶ological research, but has
  thrown much new light upon various disputed points both relative to
  Chatterton's relations and friends, which go far to settle the opinion,
  that the venerable Rowley, and not the boy Chatterton, was the writer of
  the poems.</p>

  <p>J. M. G. is afraid that this subject is one, the revival of which
  would fail to interest the public mind, or he might be induced to publish
  the essay, to which he has reason to believe that its author would give
  his consent; and should J. M. G. again raise the controversy by sending
  to "N. &amp; Q." any detached parts, he is apprehensive that the subjects
  of them would not meet with the attention they formerly would have
  done.</p>

  <p><i>Princes' Whipping-boys</i> (Vol. v., pp. 468. 545.).&mdash;In your
  publication are notices respecting two whipping-boys, Edward Browne and
  William Murray, who both endured punishment for the offences of English
  princes. I, however, think it not improbable such infliction was
  perpetrated in other kingdoms, and perhaps in Spain, for the improvement
  of Philip III. or some such worthy scion of royalty. Le Sage, who was a
  most incomparable observer of men and manners, has, in his admirable
  novel of <i>Gil Blas</i>, introduced, with purely natural humour, and in
  his style so <i>na√Øf</i>, an instance of such mode of correction. In
  livre 5i√®me, chap. i., there is the history of Don Rapha√´l, who at twelve
  years of age was selected by the Marquis de Leganez to be the companion
  of his son of the same age, who "ne paraissait pas n√© pour les sciences,"
  and scarcely knew a letter of his alphabet. The story goes on with
  describing various endeavours of his masters to induce him to apply to
  his studies, but without success: till at last the <i>Pr√©cepteur</i>
  thought of the expedient to give <i>le fouet</i> to young Rapha√´l
  whenever the little Leganez deserved it; and this he did without mercy,
  till Rapha√´l determined to elope from the roof of the Marquis de Leganez:
  and in some degree to revenge himself for all the injustice he had
  suffered, took with him all the <i>argent comptant</i> of the Pr√©cepteur,
  amounting to one hundred and fifty ducats. In concluding, I may observe
  that there is a very neat edition of <i>Gil Blas</i> lately published in
  Paris, with <i>illustrated vignettes</i> by <i>Gigoux</i>, one of which
  represents the Pr√©cepteur operating upon the unfortunate Rapha√´l:</p>

  <p class="author">F. R. A.</p>

  <p>"<i>Pinch of Snuff</i>" (Vol. vi., p. 431).&mdash;I have been informed
  by a gentleman conversant in literary matters, that the author or
  compiler of this little volume was Benson Earle Hill, formerly an officer
  in the artillery, but at the time of his death (circa 1842-3) a performer
  or prompter at one of the theatres in the Strand.</p>

  <p>I may here mention another humorous little work, closely allied to the
  above, and entitled <i>A Paper of Tobacco; treating of the Rise,
  Progress, Pleasures and Advantages of Smoking: with Anecdotes of
  distinguished Smokers, Mems. on Pipes and Tobacco-boxes: and a Tritical
  Essay on Snuff. By Joseph Fume</i>. 2nd ed., with additions. Lond.
  Chapman and Hall, 1839. 12mo. It contains six spirited and characteristic
  etchings by "Phiz," besides several woodcuts; and is a very amusing book,
  well worthy of being enlarged, for which there are ample materials both
  in prose and rhyme.</p>

  <p><i>Race for Canterbury</i> (Vol. vii., p. 219.).&mdash;J. F. infers
  that Hoadley was a competitor with Herring and Gibson for the
  archiepiscopal throne after the death of Bishop Potter, because he is
  mentioned in some lines under the woodcut broadside in his possession. He
  may also find him alluded to in the last lines of the other print in his
  possession:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Then may he win the prize who none will oppress,</p>
      <p>And the palace at Lambeth be <i>Benjamin's</i> mess."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Benjamin being Benjamin Hoadley.</p>

  <p>I have two other prints upon this subject, besides the three mentioned
  by J. F. In one which has the title "For Lambeth," the bishop in the most
  distant boat has dropt his oars, sits with his arms across, looks very
  sulky, and exclaims, "Damn my scull."</p>

  <p>The other is entitled "Haw'y Haw'y L&mdash;b-th Haw'y." Three bishops,
  as in the others, are rowing towards Lambeth: a fourth, approaching in an
  opposite direction, is rowing "against tide." In the foreground are two
  groups. In one, two noblemen are addressing three competing bishops: "Let
  honour be the reward of virtue, and not interest." One bishop says: "I
  give it up till <!-- Page 269 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page269"></a>{269}</span>next." Another holds a paper, inscribed
  "10,000<i>l.</i> for it." In the other group, two noblemen are promising
  to different bishops. Another bishop is fighting his way through boatmen;
  and two persons are running forward as candidates for an archdeaconry or
  dean of arches. Underneath are two lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Sculls, sculls to Lambeth! see how hard they pull 'em!</p>
      <p>But sure the Temple's nearer much than Fulham."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Temple</i> alluding to Sherlock, <i>Fulham</i> to Gibson.</p>

  <p>Underneath this print, some one, perhaps Horace Walpole, mistaking the
  date and the subject, has written:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The man whose place they thought to take</p>
      <p>Is still alive, and still <i>a Wake</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There is still another print entitled "Lambeth," where three bishops
  are rowing from Lambeth, with the word "Disappointed" under them. A
  fourth is rowed towards Lambeth by a waterman, who exclaims "Your're all
  Bob'd!"</p>

  <p><i>Chichester Pallant</i> (Vol. vii., p. 206.).&mdash;Chichester, I
  need not say, is of Roman foundation, and has several marks of its Roman
  origin; the little stream that runs through it is called the
  <i>Lavant</i>, evidently from <i>lavando</i>. The <i>Pallant</i>, the
  chief quarter of the town, and, of old, a <i>separate jurisdiction</i>,
  was called "Palatinus sive Palenta." "Palantia, Palatinatus," says
  Ducange, "jurisdictio ejus qui habet jus lites decidendi supremo jure."
  The <i>Pallant</i> of Chichester is not to be confounded with the
  Bishop's <i>Palace</i>. It is in a different district, and was, no doubt,
  from Roman times, a separate <i>palatine</i> jurisdiction.</p>

  <p><i>Scarfs worn by Clergymen</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 143. 215.).&mdash;As
  <span class="sc">Mr. Jebb</span> has intervened voluntarily in this
  question, not merely as an inquirer or reasoner, but as an
  <i>evidence</i> to <i>facts</i>, I hope I may be allowed to ask him his
  authority for the distinction "between broad and narrow scarfs." After
  this assertion as to the <i>fact</i>, he adds his own personal authority
  of having "in his boyhood <i>heard mention</i> made of that distinction."
  As I do not know his age, I would beg to ask <i>when</i> and <i>where</i>
  he heard that <i>mention</i>; and to make my inquiry more clear, I would
  ask whether he has any (and what) authority for the <i>fact</i> of the
  distinction beyond having "in his boyhood <i>heard mention</i> of it?" We
  must get at the facts before we can reason on them.</p>

  <p><i>Alicia Lady Lisle</i> (Vol. vii., p. 236.).&mdash;The lady referred
  to was Alice, or Alicia, daughter and coheir of Sir White Beconsawe: she
  was beheaded at Winchester, 1685. The jury by whom she was tried had, it
  is stated, thrice acquitted her; but the judge, that disgrace to human
  nature, Jefferies, insisted upon a conviction. Her husband was John Lisle
  the regicide, a severe republican, and one of the Protector's lords. An
  account of the family will be found in <i>Curious Memoirs of the
  Protectorate House of Cromwell</i>, vol. i. p. 273.</p>

  <p>The family of the present Lord Lisle, whose family name is
  <i>Lysaght</i>, and elevated to the peerage of Ireland in 1758, has
  nothing to do with that of the republican court.</p>

  <p>Respecting the old baronies of Lisle, full accounts will be found in
  the admirable report of the claim to that barony by Sir Harris Nicolas,
  one of the counsel for the claimant, Sir John Shelley Sidney: 8vo. Lond.

  <p><i>Major-General Lambert</i> (Vol. vii., p. 237.).&mdash;Major-General
  Lambert appears, from a meagre memoir of him given in the <i>History of
  Malham in Yorkshire</i>, by Thomas Hursley: 8vo. 1786, to have descended
  from a very ancient family in that county. According to the register of
  Kirkby Malhamdale, he was born at Calton Hall, in that parish, 7th of
  September, 1619, and lost his father at the age of thirteen. On the 10th
  of September, 1639, he married Frances, daughter of his neighbour Sir
  William Lister, of Thornton, in Craven, then in her seventeenth year, and
  said to have been a most elegant and accomplished lady. Nothing seems to
  be known as to the precise time or place of the death of Lambert or his
  wife, beyond the tradition of his having been imprisoned in Cornet
  Castle, in the island of Guernsey, after the Restoration, and that he
  remained in confinement thirty years. His marriage is confirmed in the
  account of Lord Ribblesdale's family in Collins' <i>Peerage</i>, vol.
  viii. edition Brydges. John Lambert, son and heir of the major-general,
  married Barbara, daughter of Thomas Lister, of Arnoldsbigging, and had by
  her three sons, who all died v. p., and one daughter, who was the wife of
  Sir John Middleton, of Belsay Castle, in Northumberland, and became the
  heir-general of her family. Pepys speaks of Lady Lambert in 1668.</p>

  <p>Perhaps these very imperfect notices may elicit further
  information,&mdash;on which account only can they be worthy of a place in
  "N. &amp; Q."</p>

  <p><i>Mistletoe</i> (Vol. iii., pp. 192. 396.).&mdash;In addition to the
  trees, on which the mistletoe grows, mentioned by "the late learned Mr.
  Ray" in the quotation cited by Dr. Wilbraham Falconer, I subjoin others
  named in Jesse's <i>Country Life</i>, some of which I have had
  opportunities of verifying viz., horse-chestnut; maple (<i>Acer
  opalus</i>, <i>A. rubrum</i>, <i>A. campestre</i>); poplar (<i>Populus
  alba</i>, <i>P. nigra</i>, <i>P. fastigiata</i>); acacia, laburnum, pear;
  large-leaved sallow (<i>Salix caprea</i>); locust tree (<i>Robinia
  pseudo-acacia</i>); larch, Scotch fir, spruce fir; service tree (<i>Pyrus
  domestica</i>); hornbeam <!-- Page 270 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page270"></a>{270}</span>(<i>Carpinus ostrya</i>); <i>Loranthus
  Europ√¶us</i> (itself a parasite); olive, vine, walnut, plum, common
  laurel, medlar, grey poplar. The localities and authorities are
  stated.</p>

  <p>In answer to your correspondent <span class="sc">Ache</span>, I may
  add, that the opinion of recent botanists is contrary to Sir Thomas
  Browne's notion with reference to the propagation of the seed; for it is
  known that the seeds, in germinating, send their radicles into the plant
  to which they are attached; and grow afterwards as true parasites,
  selecting certain chemical ingredients in preference to others. The
  mistletoe has never been known to grow in Ireland; but its frequency in
  various parts of the world&mdash;in France, Italy, Greece, and parts of
  Asia&mdash;has been remarked by travellers. Its use seems to be to
  provide food for birds during those rare seasons of scarcity, when a very
  sparing supply of other fruits and seeds can be procured.</p>

  <p><i>The Sizain</i> (Vol. vi., p. 603.; Vol. vii., p. 174.).&mdash;I
  know not whether any one of the sizains you have published may be the
  original, from which all the others must be considered as imitations or
  parodies; but they bring to my mind an English example, which I met with
  many years ago in some book of miscellanies. I do not recollect whether
  the book in question attributed it to any particular author; who, I
  presume, must have been some staunch adherent for Protestant ascendancy
  in the early part of the last century:</p>

  <p><i>Venda</i> (Vol. vii., p. 179.).&mdash;This word, in Portuguese,
  signifies a place where wine and meat are sold by retail in a tavern. It
  also appears to answer to the Spanish <i>Venta</i>, a road-side inn;
  something between the French and English inn, and the Eastern
  caravansaries. In the places which C. E. F. mentions, <i>Venda</i> in
  Portugal is like Osteria in Italy, of which plenty will be seen on the

  he would find that there <i>was</i> "a nation of the assassins;" and that
  his idea of the derivation of the name, which was first indicated by De

  <p><i>Epigrams</i> (Vol. vii., p. 175.).&mdash;The true version of the

  follows:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"'Twixt Footman John and Doctor Toe,</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Perhaps the "John" ought to be "Thomas;" for I find, on the same page

  <p><i>Use of Tobacco before the Discovery of America</i> (Vol. iv., p.
  208.).&mdash;Sandys, in the year 1610, mentions the use of tobacco as a
  custom recently introduced, at Constantinople, by the English. (See
  <i>Modern Traveller</i>.) Meyen, however, in his <i>Outlines of the
  Geography of Plants</i>, as translated for the Ray Society, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The consumption of tobacco in the Chinese empire is of immense
  extent, and the practice seems to be of great antiquity; for on very old
  sculptures I have observed the very same tobacco pipes which are still
  used. <!-- Page 271 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page271"></a>{271}</span><i>Besides, we now know the plant which
  furnishes the Chinese tobacco: it is even said to grow wild in the East
  Indies. It is certain that the tobacco plant of Eastern Asia is quite
  different from the American species.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is the opinion of a botanist at once distinguished for
  extensiveness of research and accuracy of detail; although Mr. J.
  Crawford, in a paper read before the Statistical Society, on the 15th of
  November, 1852, seems to incline to a contrary notion. It is, however,
  necessary to remark that his facts tend rather to elucidate the
  statistics of the plant than its natural character, so that Meyen's
  opinion must, I think, stand good until it be disproved.</p>

  of arms borne by Oldham, Bishop of Exeter, and that borne by the Oldham
  family at <i>Hatherleigh</i>, to be informed of what I believe he will
  find, upon inquiry, to be the fact, viz. that <i>Laing</i> was the

  consequently, the arms of Laing may possibly still be borne by them.</p>

  <p>Bishop Hugh Oldham, B.C.L., was one of the family of Oldenham, of
  Oldenham, co. Lancaster, which gave for arms, Sable, between three owls

  <p><i>Tortoiseshell Tom Cat.</i>&mdash;I am pretty certain that I once
  saw in "N. &amp; Q." an inquiry whether there ever was a
  well-authenticated instance of a tortoiseshell tom cat. The inclosed
  advertisement, which I have cut from <i>The Times</i> of the 19th
  January, 1853, will perhaps give some of your readers an opportunity of
  testing the fact:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"To be sold, a real Tortoiseshell Tom Cat. This natural rarity is
  fifteen months old and eight lbs. weight. Apply to John Sayer, Mr.
  Bennison's, bookseller, Market-Drayton, Salop."</p>

  <p><i>Irish Rhymes</i> (Vol. vi., and Vol. vii., p. 52.).&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Cuthbert Bede</span>, in his notice of the Irish rhymes in
  Swift's poetry, quoted one couplet in which <i>put</i> rhymes to
  <i>cut</i>. Is this pronunciation of the word <i>put</i> an Irishism?</p>

  <p>A late distinguished divine, who, although he occupied an Irish see,
  was certainly no Irishman, and who was remarkably particular and, I
  believe, correct in his diction, always pronounced this word in this
  manner (as indeed every other word with the same termination is
  pronounced: as <i>rut</i>, <i>cut</i>, <i>shut</i>, <i>nut</i>,
  <i>but</i>, &amp;c.).</p>

  <p>The bishop to whom I allude pronounced the word thus, long before he
  ever had any communication with Ireland: and it is strange that, although
  I have been in Ireland myself, I never heard <i>put</i> pronounced so as
  to rhyme with <i>cut</i> by any native of that island.</p>

  <p>The following extract is a note by Lord Mahon, in vol. i. p. 374. of
  his edition of Lord Chesterfield's <i>Letters to his Son</i> (Bentley,
  1847). I cannot see how the quotation from Boswell bears upon either
  <i>accent</i> or <i>cadence</i>; it appears to relate entirely to
  different modes of pronunciation:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It may be observed, however, that the questions of what are 'false
  accents and cadences' in our language appear to have been far less
  settled in Lord Chesterfield's time than at present. Dr. Johnson says:
  'When I published the plan for my dictionary, Lord Chesterfield told me
  that the word <i>great</i> should be pronounced so as to rhyme with
  <i>state</i>; and Sir William Yonge sent me word, that it should be
  pronounced so as to rhyme to <i>seat</i>, and that none but an Irishman
  would pronounce it <i>grait</i>. Now, here were two men of the highest
  rank,&mdash;the one the best speaker in the House of Lords, the other the
  best speaker in the House of Commons&mdash;differing
  entirely."&mdash;Boswell's <i>Life</i>, Notes of March 27, 1772.</p>

  <p><i>Consecrated Rings</i> (Vol. vii., p. 88.).&mdash;The inquiry opened
  by <span class="sc">Sir W. C. T.</span> is shown to be one of much
  interest by the able communication of your correspondent <span
  class="sc">Ceyrep</span>. I trust he will excuse me in expressing strong
  doubts as to <!-- Page 272 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page272"></a>{272}</span>Havering, the chapel in Essex, being so
  called from "having the ring." Nothing is more dangerous to any
  etymological solution than the being guided by the sound of words, rather
  than by the probable derivation of the name of the place or thing
  signified. I am aware that Camden says Havering is called so for the
  above-stated reason; and other compilers of topography have followed what
  I venture to suggest is an error. <i>Habban</i>, in Anglo-Saxon, means to
  have; and <i>Ring</i> is ring&mdash;this is not to be denied; but in the
  general (and let me add excellent) rules for the investigation of names
  of places affixed to the late Dr. Ingram's <i>Translation of the Saxon
  Chronicle</i>, I find <i>Aver</i> is from Aver, Br., the mouth of a
  river, ford, or lake; and <i>Ing</i>, it is well known, is a frequent
  termination for the names of places&mdash;its import in Anglo-Saxon being
  a meadow. How far "the meadow near the source of the river, or stream"
  applies to the site of <i>Havering</i>, I will leave to those more
  competent than myself to decide, but offer the suggestion to the
  consideration of <span class="sc">Ceyrep</span> and others.</p>

  <p><i>Derivation of Lowbell</i> (Vol. vii., p. 181.).&mdash;In my younger
  days I frequently had occasion to draw out (from old established
  precedent) the form of an appointment, by the lord, of a gamekeeper for a
  manor, in which the latter was authorised and required to seize and
  destroy all and all manner of gins, snares, springs, &amp;c., including a
  dozen or more technical words, one of which was "lowbells." The manors in
  question were in Dorsetshire and Somersetshire, but I doubt not but that
  the same form was adopted in other counties in various parts of England.
  Being strongly impressed with the familiarity of the word on reading H.
  T. W.'s Note, I was induced to refer to Johnson's <i>Dictionary</i>,
  where I find my own notion fully borne out as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">Lowbell.</span>&mdash;A kind of fowling in the
  night, in which the birds are wakened by a bell and lured by a
  flame."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>At this moment I have only the abridged edition (3rd edition, 1766) to
  refer to, and that does not give any reference or authority for the
  definition in question. I would observe, however, that I believe "loke"
  is either a Saxon or Scandinavian word, signifying a flame or firebrand,
  which, coupled with "bell," fully bears out the definition, and I think
  sufficiently accounts for the term "lowbelling" in H. T. W.'s Note, as
  the offender might have been greeted with bells and firebrands in lieu of
  the "tin pots and kettles," or by way of addition to them.</p>

  <p>May not this also serve to explain what is considered as a puzzling
  term in Beaumont and Fletcher? Lowell being nothing more nor less than a
  snare, may not "Peace, gentle lowbell," mean "Peace, gentle
  ensnarer?"</p>

  <p><i>The Negative given to the Demand of the Clergy at Merton</i> (Vol.

  for he observes as follows, in one of his letters (the 84th),
  that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"At a parliament under Henry III., 'Rogaverunt omnes Episcopi ut
  consentirent quod nati ante matrimonium essent legitimi, et omnes Comites
  et Barones una voce responderunt quod nolunt leges Angli√¶ mutari.' This
  famous answer has been quoted a thousand and a thousand times, and yet
  nobody seems to have understood the management. The bishops, as partizans
  of the Pope, were for subjecting England to the imperial and papal laws,
  and therefore began with a circumstance most to the taste of the Barons.
  The Barons smelt the contrivance; and rejected a proposition most
  agreeable to them, for fear of the consequences, the introduction of the
  imperial laws, whose very genius and essence was arbitrary despotic
  power. Their answer shows it: 'Nolumus leges Angli√¶ mutari:' they had
  nothing to object to the reform, but they were afraid for the
  constitution."</p>

  <p><i>Nugget</i> (Vol. vi., pp. 171. 281.; Vol. vii., p.143.).&mdash;T.
  K. arrogantly sets aside the etymology of W. S.; and, in lieu of the
  Persian <i>nugud</i> of the latter, would have us believe that
  <i>nugget</i> is nothing more than a Yankee corruption of <i>an
  ingot</i>. I <!-- Page 273 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page273"></a>{273}</span>hold with W. S. notwithstanding, and so
  will all who have had any dealings with the <i>Bengalees</i>: the term
  <i>nuggut pisa</i> being with them a common one for "hard cash;" and as
  the Hindostanee language is largely indebted to the Persian, the
  derivation of W. S. is no doubt correct. To account for its occurrence in
  Australia, it is only necessary to say that that country has been for
  some years past a <i>sanatarium</i> for the debilitated <i>Qui Hye's</i>,
  many of whom have settled there; and becoming interested in the
  "diggings," have given the significant term of <i>nuggut</i> to what has
  in reality turned out <i>hard cash</i>, both to them and to certain lucky
  gentlemen in this city&mdash;holders of the script of the "Great
  <i>Nuggut</i> Vein" of Australia.</p>

  <p class="author">J. O.</p>

  <p><i>Blackguard</i> (Vol. vii., p. 77.).&mdash;It may, in some degree,
  support the first portion of the argument so interestingly stated by
  <span class="sc">Sir J. Emerson Tennent</span> respecting the derivation
  of this term, to record that, in my youth, when at school at the New
  Academy in Edinburgh, some five or six-and-twenty years ago, I used
  frequently to be engaged, with my schoolfellows, in regular pitched
  battles, technically called by us <i>bickers</i>, with the town boys,
  consisting chiefly of butchers' and bakers' boys, whom we were accustomed
  to designate as <i>the blackguards</i>, without, I am sure, ever
  attaching to that word the more opprobrious meaning which it now
  generally bears; but only indicating by it those of a lower rank in life
  than ourselves, <i>the gentlemen</i>.</p>

  <p>May I venture to add, that whilst the former portion of <span
  class="sc">Sir J. E. Tennent's</span> Note seems to me to be fully
  satisfactory in proof that the term <i>blackguard</i> is originally
  derived from the ancient appellation of menials employed in the lowest
  and most dirty offices of a great household, and that it is thus purely
  English,&mdash;the last two paragraphs, on the other hand, appear to
  advocate an unnecessary and far-fetched derivation of the word from the
  French, and which, I humbly conceive, the true sense of the alleged
  roots, <i>blague</i>, <i>blaguer</i>, <i>blagueur</i>, by no means
  justifies; it being impossible to admit that these are, in any sort,
  "corresponding terms" with <i>blackguard</i>.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Long and anxiously has the reading public been looking for Mr.
  Layard's account of his further discoveries in Nineveh and Babylon. That
  account has at length appeared in one large octavo volume, under the
  title of <i>Discoveries in the Ruins of Nineveh and Babylon, with Travels
  in Armenia, Kurdistan, and the Desert, being the result of a Second
  Expedition undertaken for the Trustees of the British Museum, by</i>
  Austen H. Layard, M.P., and is enriched with maps, plans, and woodcut
  illustrations, to the extent of some hundreds. And on examining it we
  find that the vast amount of new light which Mr. Layard's discoveries in
  the wide and hitherto untilled field of Assyrian antiquities had already
  thrown on Sacred History, is increased to a great extent by those further
  researches, of which the details are now given to the public. With his
  ready powers of observation, and his talent for graphic description, Mr.
  Layard's book, as a mere volume of travels over a country of such
  interest, would well repay perusal: but when we find in addition, as we
  do in every page and line, fresh and startling illustration of the truth
  of Holy Writ&mdash;when we have put before us such pictures of what
  Nineveh and Babylon must have been, and find, as we do, men distinguished
  in every branch of learning lending their assistance to turn Mr. Layard's
  discoveries to the best account, we feel we cannot be too loud in our
  praises of Mr. Layard's zeal, energy, and judgment, or too grateful to
  Mr. Murray for giving us at once the results which those qualities have
  enabled Mr. Layard to gain for us, in so cheap, complete, yet fully
  embellished a form.</p>

  <p>The blockade of Mainz was not a bad day for the already world-renowned
  story of <i>Reynard the Fox</i>, since that led G√∂the to dress the old
  fable up again in his musical hexameters, and so give it new popularity.
  From G√∂the's version a very able and spirited English paraphrase is now
  in the course of publication. We say paraphrase, because the author of
  <i>Reynard the Fox, after the German version of G√∂the, with illustrations
  by</i> J. Wolf, takes as his motto the very significant but appropriate
  description which G√∂the gave of his own work, "Zwischen Uebersetzung und
  Umarbeitung schwebend." However, the version is a very pleasant one, and
  the illustrations are characteristic and in good taste.</p>

  and with it of a general index to the whole work.&mdash;<i>The Physical

  Advancement of Learning, in Nine Books, and his Novum Organum, or
  Precepts for the Interpretation of Nature</i>, by Joseph Devey, M.A.,

  <p>"Mr. Ross prepares lenses for Portraiture having the greatest
  intensity yet produced, by procuring the coincidence of the chemical
  actinic and visual rays. The spherical aberration is also very carefully
  corrected, both in the central and oblique pencils."</p>

  furnished with a double achromatic object-lens, about three inches

  <p>MR. R. W. THOMAS begs most earnestly to caution photographers against
  purchasing impure chemicals, which are now too frequently sold at very
  low prices. It is to this cause nearly always that their labours are
  unattended with success.</p>

  <p>Chemicals of absolute purity, especially prepared for this art, may be
  obtained from R. W. THOMAS, Chemist and Professor of Photography, 10.
  Pall Mall.</p>

  <p>N.B.&mdash;The name of Mr. T.'s preparation, Xylo-Iodide of Silver, is
  made use of by unprincipled persons. To prevent imposition each bottle is
  stamped with a red label bearing the maker's signature.</p>

  <p>* <span class="sc">Example.</span>&mdash;At the commencement of the
  year 1841, a person aged thirty took out a Policy for 1000<i>l.</i>, the
  annual payment for which is 24<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; in 1847 he
  had paid in premiums 168<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; but the profits
  being 2¬º per cent. per annum on the sum insured (which is 22<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> per annum for each 1000<i>l.</i>) he had 157<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> added to the Policy, almost as much as the premiums paid.</p>

  <p>The Premiums, nevertheless, are on the most moderate scale, and only
  one-half need be paid for the first five years, when the Insurance is for
  Life. Every information will be afforded on application to the Resident
  Director.</p>
